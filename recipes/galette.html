    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This frangipane-filled galette des rois is traditionally enjoyed in January, but you can make it whenever you’re craving a sweet treat.</b>
    A galette des rois is a French cake that consists of frangipane sandwiched between two puff pastry circles. It is baked in January to celebrate Epiphany, which is the day the Three Kings (les rois) visited Jesus. A galette des rois traditionally has a “fève” baked into it -– this can be a trinket (often a small baby figurine) or a bean. 

    Often, a paper crown is used to decorate the dessert and whoever finds the fève gets to wear the crown.</p>
